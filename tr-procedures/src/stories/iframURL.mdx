# Generate IFRAME URL of a manual

## Concept Overview

This feature is used to get the URL of any manual to provide it for a client.

To use it we go to the manual we want to work with, which is uploaded in the OneDrive, click on the three dots and click on Insert:

![Example of Image](./TRAZITParadigm/iframeURL/InsertIframe.jpg)

It will open a pop-up on the right of the screen which will allow us to generate a new HTML code to insert it in another file.

After that we can select the iframe URL and paste it in another file. If the iframe was already generated the previous step won't be needed:
